# CF_A6_University_World_Ranks_Analysis
For my Sixth achievement in CareerFoundryâ€™s data analysis course, I need to source my own data set, and perform my own analysis using Python.
## Objective
The Center for World University Rankings is a website that ranks the effectiveness of universities around the world. My task is to figure out what impacts a universities world rank.
## Data
To source the data that I wanted to use I went to Kaggle and found [this data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings) from Myles O'Neill
## Procedure
All of the python code was done in Jupyter Notebooks. Afterwards I went to Tableau to make a storyboard you can see [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/aaron.johnson6156/viz/A6_17401398739770/Story1?publish=yes)
